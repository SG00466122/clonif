    "transcription": "Hi there this is Ranjeet and in this video I'll be giving you an overview of this Moto X60 Pro smartphone that I have been actually using it for the last six days in fact I did also travel to Goa so I've taken a lot of what do you say camera samples with this one and even videos I'll add that in the later part of the video during the end part of the video and again guys just want to make it clear that this video is made in collaboration with Motorola and this is a review unit that was actually sent to me by Motorola India but no way I'm giving any script or flow of the video to Motorola and all the testing and the samples that you are seeing was independently shot by me so this is what it comes inside the box so this is what it is and if you look at the back it says that it has Dolby what do you say stereo of course Dolby stereo speakers that we are having also it has a high-res audio that means if you have some high-end headphones that have the higher codecs like LDAC etc that is actually supported on this one and also it says Corning this is now having a Corning Gorilla Glass 7i on the same and apart from this in the box we also get a 90 watt charger in the box and a USB type C to type C cable sadly there is no actually case inside the box so that's what we get and also now as the pricing is out I have to talk about it the good thing is that any variant that you buy in India will come with a minimum of 256 gigabytes of storage and the good thing is that now finally it is UFS 3 4.0 storage that we are getting and it comes in two variants the base will have 8 gigabytes of RAM and the higher end variant will have 12 gigabytes of RAM and the pricing is also good I feel the base variant that comes with 8 gigabytes of RAM the 256 gigabytes of storage is for 30,000 and for 4,000 more you will be getting that 12 gigabytes of RAM and this is the handset itself again in terms of layout again very similar to earlier Motorola phones they're following this this what do you say this faux leather kind of a thing and here also it's actually faux leather but here the texture at least on this blue variant is slightly different it has this nylon kind of a finish so in fact it actually gives a good grip to the glass and if you do this again you get that sound so again in terms of grip it's having a nice grip and again the big highlight of this smartphone I have to say is the camera and the improved processor that we are getting I'll talk about all the details later on again camera is a big focus I was actually very impressed with the camera performance of this one in fact it actually beats a lot of smartphones that cost a lot more I feel in the camera department in fact my wife was having a what do you say foldable smartphone flagship foldable smartphone that cost it more than three times than this one but when I was in Goa she was preferring taking photographs with this one anyways coming to the layout of the smartphone again it has that quad what do you say curved edges but this time the bezels are even thin I would say very very thin on this one and it's a 6.7 inches Amoled POLED screen that we are getting again of course it has that in display fingerprint scanner and all those things and the screen quality is actually good even in hot sun when I was taking photographs the screen is adequately bright that we call the high brightness mode it can go up to 1400 dinit sustained so that's actually good so even in outdoor situation the screen is visible but they claim that in peak HDR it's 4500 net but nevertheless I would say it's easily visible I would say in in fact the it can actually get pretty bright let me just lower the brightness again the in terms of UI it's that typical Motorola new UI that you are getting you have the toggles over here and we'll talk about that later and again this is as expected that 120 Hertz screen that you are getting 120 Hertz the refresh rate that you're getting also the screen quality in terms of accuracy it's good it's supporting the DC DC IP 3 gamut so again if you're doing some color accurate work then also it's good but by default what I've noticed is that the screen is set to those punchier colors if you go to the settings and if you go to the display by default it is set to vivid which most of you will like that punchy colors but if you are into some color critical work like photography etc just put it to natural then you'll get those accurate colors in fact this screen is also Pantone validated and also has some additional good features like DC dimming etc now it's coming with a very big battery but still it's actually very slim and just weighs 186 grams this is now having a 6000 milliamp hour battery thanks to that silicon carbide battery though it's having that 6000 milliamp hour battery the handset weight is very well managed in fact still it is that 186 grams I think so they were able to do it because this outer chases that we have is now not metal but the polycarbonate but again I don't think so you have to worry too much because now this is getting the military STD 810H rating for durability the battery life is actually very good on this one as you expect but again one thing to notice that and I'm saddened with this new Moto UI if you go to the battery stats and of course I didn't use the battery saver if you go to the battery usage etc it no way actually gives you the battery SOT value so again I had to rely on third-party apps etc and those are not very accurate for battery stats but again this is AccuBattery and as you can see according to this one based on the last charges or whatever it says that you can get about 10 hours of SOT on this one at maximum if you are just opening the screen and just leaving it you can get up to 15 hours of screen on time and standby time of course is very very good I was averaging easily about one and a half days in worth of what do you say battery life even when I was traveling it was continuously only on mobile data for example I had to get up in the morning because it was early flight that we took to go up 430 in the morning the flight was at 7 a.m. so it was off the charger at 4 from 430 in the morning completely on mobile data and at the end of that day about 11 o'clock when we were sleeping it still had 30% battery life and of course I mean you're in holiday you'll be taking a lot of snaps using GPS etc so that way I would say the battery life is actually very good on this smartphone and in terms of charging also with the supplied charger that you are getting it will charge completely in about 55 minutes the good thing is that of course this is a fast charger that you're getting but even if you have a normal PD charger again it also can be charged with PD charging it supports that PD charging standard 3 coming to the call quality the earpiece call quality is good and also I like that the network reception was very good even in Goa and some areas where I was going near the beach the signal was not that great but then also the voice quality was good so that way I would say in terms of network reception etc they have done a good job of course this also does support wireless charging I didn't extensively test wireless charging but I did test the wireless charging in my car my car has a wireless charger and yes it did charge Motorola claims the wireless charging is up to 15 watts and also it does support reverse wireless charging up to 5 watt for example if you have those earbuds etc you can use that reverse wireless charging so that way I would say if you look at the specs point of view here are all the specs in terms of specs it is having all the specs that you expect on this one in fact I would say it has almost every spec that you expect generally with even flagships all these specs are there this one has the MediaTek Diamond City 8350 Xtreme which is again of based on 4 nanometer it's octa-core processor and I have to say the processor is actually pretty good though I did run a benchmark and in fact Antutu I was getting a value of 1.4 million on this one and if we compare it with the last generations of h50 Pro that has the snapdragon 7 gen 3 and that was getting a Antutu score of about 8 lakhs so this processor is almost 80% faster than this one and that shows in the performance in fact it also has a big NPU on this one that's why if you notice there is a dedicated key over here for AI functions I'll talk about that later so in terms of performance I have to say the performance of this one is actually very good in fact some of you have asked me about the camera lag there's no camera lag etc on this one so that way I would say the processor is good also it does have a big vapor chamber and during my regular usage when I was in Goa for a couple of days I didn't play games but I was heavily using the phone for regular stuff GPS taking cameras again the phone did not heat up but I did I'm not a big gamer guys I did play Call of Duty a little bit for about half an hour and during that this got slightly warm but no way hot so I think so the bigger vapor chamber that they have putting on this one is also making a big difference regarding the Android updates out of the box this comes with Android 15 and Motorola is telling we'll get next three Android upgrades and four years of security updates so that is what it is regarding the same and overall I would say it's a very very fluid the phone and again it does have a lot of AI functions I have to talk about it again we have a dedicated section here for AI again these are the AI options that it is having and let me quickly talk about it and again we have this dedicated button also for AI invoking the AI and we have two modes in this by default again there is nothing on the phone so I'll show you like this if you just hold hold sorry if you just hold it for a second it invokes and by default you'll get these update me remember the or take notes update me is nothing but it gathers what do you say we have a lot of notifications let's say a lot of messages from whatsapp or Twitter etc if you just another apps it'll just for example it is just summarizing some whatsapp message that I got like this so again it categorizes summary of your notification important notifications so you don't have to go over everything and it does a decent job of filtering unnecessary what do you say spammy notifications and stuff so that is one thing and now let me do one thing let me just open up what do you say this is a web page that some article on what do you say economic times I just hit again that key and now it is trying to actually AI is going to analyze what is there on the screen and gives an idea about this for example we can remember this and remember this is like a screenshot I would say this I feel it's good for screenshots for example you get your some tickets or some random some stuff that you need to use it later you can just use that but apart from this if you notice now with this article it is also showing me some other options for example first let's see this article is a big article I read it but I want a little bit more information and I feel this is good for people who are doing research work or whatever this is very easy just hit this explore with the what do you say perplexity and this is built it and now it gives you a little bit more info about that article and beside that what is happening so this is a great way for example what are the strategies I want to know what is happening so now if I click this this will open in perplexity and give you a lot more information so this is a big time saver if you are doing some research work etc I would say the built-in option that we have it's actually good but apart from that let's just go back to that article again and I'll hit this AI button and hit that and I'll hit this more actions option and here we have a few more options you can actually create a sticker out of this one it is actually pretty good and generate what do you say images Apple whatever it's a based on whatever subject for example let's create a sticker for this what do you say article or whatever and now it will try to create a sticker based on what the story is and yes it does take 15-20 seconds and Motorola was telling that as this has a decent NPU it actually can do a lot of processing locally on this smartphone and as you can see it has created some stickers in fact it actually does a pretty good job let me show you at the gallery I was playing around with this one if I go to photos and if I go to collections on this device as you can see in the image studio it actually created this image this image so these can be actually we can also create our avatars etc I did this you can just upload your image and ask it to create an avatar and as you can see it did actually a pretty good job unlike many of the AIs which make your face look too cartoony that it's not recognizable so these are the things and again these were some I was reading some tax article and I told you to create a what you say image like this and as you can see it did actually pretty good stuff so these are some of the stuff that we have with AI and apart from that of course if I click over this again and if I go to actions we also have the image studio on this one which you can just type in whatever and it creates an image apart from that also we have a playlist studio for example let's say it's trying to create a what do you say playlist on whatever you want for example I'll say create music I'll just say music energetic music for evil me it can also understand the context and create it but I'm just doing this and now the AI will actually create a playlist for us and in fact it has if you have what do you say what is that Amazon music it will actually send that playlist to Amazon music and you can directly and as you can see it has now created this I don't know yeah you guys let me know what do you and I can just click this open with Amazon music and it's not going to create this playlist and send it to Amazon music where you can play it as you can see it's now opening Amazon music and this is the playlist that it has created so again these are some of the new AI features that we are having on this one so interesting job that Motorola is doing but apart from this I would say you all have all the other Motorola features that you expect like family spaces moto secure even if you have what do you say other Motorola devices you can have that smart connect and all those things and again if you are new to Motorola you can use this to customize and apart from that again traditional moto stuff like chop chop for what do you say opening the flashlight twist and all those things are there it also has the in-display fingerprint scanner and as you can see it works well it's slightly on the bottom side I got used to it but yeah in terms of accuracy it's working well now coming to the UI again it's very very close again left you have the what do you say Google paint but again you also have the news feed option in this one and this also pulls news feeds I would say from Adobe but if you don't want it you can actually disable it so that's what it is but one thing I noticed is that there were a lot of extra games for example this bot store bubble candy crash there was one more game guest thief and one more that were pre-installed apart from LinkedIn was also pre-installed so again Motorola is adding these extra games to this one which I personally don't like but I think so they wanted to price this smartphone below 30,000 even without bank offers but you guys let me know what do you feel about the same the main camera is a Sony what do you say light year 700 C with optical image stabilization next we have a 50 mega again this is also 50 megapixel that's ultra wide camera but again this also has autofocusing so that's why it can also do macro and the third camera is actually a 3x zoom camera that is a 10 megapixel but with AI it says you can go up to 50x but we can get pretty good shots up to 20 25x and the front camera again is also a 15 megapixel shooter and one thing that I noticed is that many people were asking me that shutter lag or in the processing lag that we used to have is actually not there on this smartphone as you can see we took that photograph and it's processed quickly so like this like this I can take pictures and it does that processing very quickly another thing that I noticed and I liked about this one is that and it's a big improvement is that in night when you are taking photographs not only this phone many of the smartphones when you hit the shutter there is a delay of one second or something like that here the delay even a night a shot is one of the lowest that I have noticed but let me do one thing let me actually show you the camera samples in the video samples that I've taken with this smartphone let's start with some outdoor shots during the day and as you can see the shots come out actually pretty good this was regular 1x and this was 3x zoom and these are some other casual shots that I took and again this is 1x and this is again 1x this was 3x and this was about 15x digital zoom another example 1x this was 3x zoom and this was about 17x digital zoom this was 640 so Sun had set this 1x this was that 3x zoom and here I must have zoomed to about 14x one more picture before it became completely dark this was with the regular lens and this was with that 3x lens now for some pictures taken in very low lighting conditions dark conditions and here I have to say this Moto Edge Pro actually surprised me with the pictures that it could take I really like this shot this was taken with the main lens and now I use the 3x zoom from the same location needless to say in low lighting condition it's doing a terrific job some more pictures that were taken in pretty low lighting conditions some more sample pictures that were shot just before the sunset and this was that 1x and this was taken with the 3x zoom lens the color reproduction and dynamic range is actually very good this was regular shot this was taken in the portrait mode and in portrait mode you can zoom in with different levels now moving to the front-facing camera this is in the regular mode and this was in the portrait mode and I feel the background blur by default is too much at 3 here I'd set the background blur at 2 and this looks like a better picture again some more samples taken with the front-facing camera and I have to say the front-facing camera performance is very good this was in the portrait mode with the front-facing camera on the left the picture is taken in the regular mode but on the right I use the portrait mode I really like the portrait mode on this one as it does not blur even the hairs and stuff like that recording this footage in 4k with the front-facing camera I'm in Goa and again mixed lighting conditions as you can see it's a little bit windy so there might be wind noise I'll just go in the Sun to see how it is right now I'm in the Sun let me move to a shadowed area to give you an idea how it handles that abrupt what do you say exposure and stuff so this is a very quick sample recorded with the front-facing camera shooting this video with the rear-facing camera and I've set it to actually 4k 30 FPS and we can zoom in now I'm just at the 3x optical zoom and I'll just come back to 1x this is ultra wide so you can move between all the focal lengths while shooting the video with the rear-facing camera so guys this is the Motorola h60 Pro smartphone and you it starts at rupees 30,000 what do you feel about the same frankly speaking I have to say this is a very good upgrade I would say if you compare it with even the last generation the processor that the Diamond City 8350 is actually pretty pretty fast it's a very good processor I also like the fact that now we are getting 256 gigabytes of storage with UFS 4.0 storage and the RAM also has been upgraded to LPDDR5 extra hence the smartphone is a lot more capable I would say and also the built-in AI features are something that can be useful and also don't forget that massive 6000 milliampere battery that we are getting for this one so at 30,000 I feel this is a very strong smartphone from Motorola but what do you guys feel about this Motorola h60 Pro do let me know in the comment section below anyways guys that's it for now thanks for watching this is Ranjeet and I hope to see you in my next video take care guys",
